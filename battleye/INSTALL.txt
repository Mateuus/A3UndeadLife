* Preparing the server

** Determine the proper location for the BattlEye files

BattlEye can live in several different places on your server depending
on command line options.

*** -bepath=

The bepath command-line option is the preferred method for specifying
the location of the BattlEye config.  This option overrides all other
configuration options and ensures that your server is looking in the
correct place.

Example: -bepath="C:\Arma 3\battleye"

*** -profiles

If bepath does not exist, the server will next look in the BattlEye
directory of the path specified by -profiles.

Example: -bepath="C:\Arma 3\AltisLife"

The BattlEye directory would then become 
"C:\Arma 3\AltisLife\BattleEye"

*** The default location

If neither -bepath nor -profiles exist as command-line options, then
the server will look for the BattlEye directory in the root of your
server installation.  

Example: If you have your server installed as C:\Arma 3\ then the
BattlEye directory is C:\Arma 3\BattlEye

** (optional) Enabling RCON

RCON has rich support for third party tools.  It *SHOULD* be enabled.

*** Create a secure password for RCON

- Point your web browser to https://www.random.org/passwords/
- Click the Get Passwords button
- Copy one of the 5 randomly generated passwords

*** Create beserver.cfg in the BattlEye directory with the following:

MaxPing 200
RConPassword <insert random password here>

* Installing the files

- Copy all the .txt files here to your BattlEye directory
- Copy your beserver.cfg file to your BattlEye directory
- Restart the server
